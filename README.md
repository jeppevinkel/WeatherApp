# WeatherApp
### POSCYD

This application has the ability to give a short description of the weather and suitable clothing in a format that's human readable as opposed to the regular weather apps that just show a bunch of arbitrary numeric values.

The app can be configured to use either GPS based location, or you can manually enter a location to get weather data from.
The app has settings for sensitivity to adjust the clothes recommendations based on individual preference.
